# Saturn

A crypto trading bot along with all the data analysis involved in development.

It started off just a single page basic script that I wrote as an experiment during the lockdown.

It evolved over the years and became more complex as I began backtesting strategies, abstracting functions and integrating different exchanges. 

It ended up making a bit of money and also was a great vehicle for me to learn data analysis in Python. 

## Key features:

- Integrating with various centralised exchanges to place trades and fetch prices
- Data analysis of historical data of various currencies. (eg. Old programs/saturn1_2/ETH_trading_data_analysis.ipnyb)
- Obtaining various metrics and indicators from current price data (saturn3/chart.py)
- Integrating with a decentralised exchange (saturn3)
- The last version of the script (ETHUSD_swingtrader3.0.py)
