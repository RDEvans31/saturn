A crypto trading bot along with all the data analysis involved in development.

It started off just a single page basic script that I wrote as an experiment during the lockdown.

It evolved over the years and became more complex as I began backtesting strategies, abstracting functions and integrating different exchanges. 

It ended up making a bit of money and also was a great vehicle for me to learn data analysis in Python.
